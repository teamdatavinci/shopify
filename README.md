# shopify

Steps:
1. Go to checkout.liquid and implement code in scripts/checkout.liquid.txt
2. Go to product-template or product-new-template.liquid and implement the code in scripts/prod.liquid.txt
3. Test if the relevant events are passed in the dataLayer
4. Import the Shopify container in your web container. In case of some mismatch error that you cannot solve at all ( should be resolvable if you know what you are doing, you can setup the shopify container and atleast reference it)
